## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Host can be any OS like Fedora 40 Linux in this case or Ubuntu, Windows etc.  
* arm-none-eabi-gcc should be installed.
* gcc should be installed.
* cmake should be installed.
* Download and install [ST-LINK](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stsw-link007.html) latest firmware.
* In this Fedora 40 OS, Download [ST-LINK](https://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/buildinfo?buildID=2389744) v1/v2 JTAG/SWD debugging/flashing tool for STM32 microcontrollers
* After above installation, Cmake still has issue with LIBUSB, and in this Fedora 40 OS using "yum provides */libusb.h"
* LIBUSB should be installed.
* STM32F4 Standard Peripheral Library Expansion [STSW-STM32120](https://www.st.com/en/embedded-software/stm32-standard-peripheral-library-expansion/products.html) should be downloaded. Find the one that has "system" under "MCU Peripheral" column. Please copy "Libraries" folder next to "BareMetal" folder (the folder contains all projects in this repository).

### Installing

* Check arm-none-eabi-gcc --version on a terminal. If it has not been installed, Fedora will suggest to install, and go with it.
* Check cmake --version on a terminal. If it has not been installed, Fedora will suggest to install, and go with it. Typically, it asks for gcc installation during installing cmake if you have not installed gcc yet.
* Install [ST-LINK](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stsw-link007.html) latest firmware using: sudo rpm -Uhv st-stlink-udev-rules-1.0.3-2-linux-noarch.rpm
* In this Fedora 40 OS, install [ST-LINK](https://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/buildinfo?buildID=2389744) v1/v2 JTAG/SWD debugging/flashing tool for STM32 microcontrollers using: sudo rpm -Uhv stlink-1.7.0-7.fc40.x86_64.rpm
* cmake has issue with LIBUSB, and in this Fedora 40 OS using "yum provides */libusb.h" command find a version of LIBUSB that suit you, and install it using (in this case): sudo dnf install libusb1-devel-1.0.27-2.fc40.x86_64
* Download stlink-testing.zip to open a terminal inside the extracted folder and run cmake.
* Run make

### Executing program

#### Bare metal with no standard library

* Open a terminal inside the folder, and run "make clean" to remove all previously generated *.hex, *.elf, *.bin, *.srec etc files, and then run "make all". Then, using OPENOCD, you can program the flash,an even debug the code using GDB or Telnet. How to do explanation wiilbe added soon.

#### Bare metal with standard library

* Follow corresponding order for "Bare metal with no standard library" above. How to do explanation wiilbe added soon.

#### Bare metal SemiHosting

* Follow corresponding order for "Bare metal with no standard library" above. How to do explanation wiilbe added soon.

#### Bare metal Empty Project with no standard library

* This example placed here for from-scratch practice. Also, Makefile was improved from previous proejcts. Follow corresponding order for "Bare metal with no standard library" above.

#### Bare metal Empty Project with standard library

* This example placed here for from-scratch practice. Follow corresponding order for "Bare metal with no standard library" above.

#### Bare metal Empty Project with SemiHosting

* This example placed here for from-scratch practice. Follow corresponding order for "Bare metal with no standard library" above.

#### LEDs blinking

* 3 LEDs on the board blink using for loop delay. Follow corresponding order for "Bare metal with no standard library" above.

#### LEDs On/Off via Push Button 

* 3 LEDs on the board turn on/off by pressing push button. Follow corresponding order for "LEDs blinking" above.

#### Virtual COM Port Transmit Character 

* A virtual COM port to send character to PC. Open a terminal inside the folder, and run "make clean" to remove "build" folder, then run "make -j all". Then, using "make stflash" flash the board.

#### Virtual COM Port Transmit Text 

* A virtual COM port to send text to PC. Follow corresponding order for "Virtual COM Port Transmit Character" above.

#### Virtual COM Port Transmit Number 

* A virtual COM port to send number to PC. Follow corresponding order for "Virtual COM Port Transmit Character" above.

#### SysTick Initialization 

* SysTick function is initialized to be used instead of for loop delay. Follow corresponding order for "Virtual COM Port Transmit Character" above.

#### Virtual COM Port Transmit/Receive Character 

* A virtual COM port to transmit and receive character to and from PC. The receive is interrupt-based. Follow corresponding order for "Virtual COM Port Transmit Character" above.

#### Virtual COM Port Transmit/Receive Text 

* A virtual COM port to transmit and receive text to and from PC. Follow corresponding order for "Virtual COM Port Transmit Character" above.

#### Virtual COM Port Buffer/Sendback 

* A virtual COM port to receive, buffer, and sendback text to PC. The reception is interrupt-based. Follow corresponding order for "Virtual COM Port Transmit Character" above.

#### UART with Buffer/Sendback 

* Beside an UART for virtual COM port, second UART is initialized to receive, buffer, and sendback text to PC. Follow corresponding order for "Virtual COM Port Transmit Character" above.

#### ADC

* An ADC channel is established, and read data send to PC via virtual COM port. Follow corresponding order for "Virtual COM Port Transmit Character" above.

#### ADC READ Float

* An ADC channel is established, and read float data send to PC via virtual COM port. Follow corresponding order for "Virtual COM Port Transmit Character" above.

#### ADC using DMA

* An ADC channel is initialized using DMA instead of making CPU busy, and read data send to PC via virtual COM port. Follow corresponding order for "Virtual COM Port Transmit Character" above.

#### ADC using DMA Reads Board Temperature

* An ADC channel is initialized using DMA instead of making CPU busy, and read board temperature data send to PC via virtual COM port. Follow corresponding order for "Virtual COM Port Transmit Character" above.

#### SPI

#### PWM Dimming

* A PWM channel is established, and LEDs are dimmed. Follow corresponding order for "Virtual COM Port Transmit Character" above.

#### DAC

* A DAC channel is established, output signal is read, and sent to PC via virtual COM port. Follow corresponding order for "Virtual COM Port Transmit Character" above.

#### Cmake

* A Cmake file added. Follow corresponding order for "Virtual COM Port Transmit Character" above.
